# Taidon

Taidon is an open-source platform for safe, reproducible SQL experimentation.  
It provides isolated environments, fast snapshot-based databases, and a unified API for executing SQL workloads without side effects.

This repository is a **monorepo** containing all components of the platform:
frontend applications, backend microservices, shared libraries, research materials, and documentation.

---

## Overview

Taidon is designed to support:

- teaching SQL;
- prototyping database-related tools;
- research on query execution and database behavior;
- reproducible environments for demonstrations and workshops.

Core ideas:

- **Reproducibility** — every SQL session starts from a known snapshot.
- **Isolation** — user actions never affect other sessions.
- **Speed** — environments start quickly and scale horizontally.
- **Extensibility** — multiple database backends, pluggable components, internal/external integrations.

The platform will eventually include:

- web UI,
- a set of microservices for SQL execution,
- snapshot and environment orchestration,
- research datasets and performance experiments,
- developer-oriented CLI tools.

## Subprojects

### **Frontend**

Located under `frontend/`.  
The main application lives in `frontend/main`, with `frontend/editor` and `frontend/plan-viewer` as UI components, and `frontend/cli-go` hosting the sqlrs CLI.

Each subproject contains its own `README.md` with setup instructions.

---

### **Backend**

Backend services are split into microservices under `backend/services/`, with a shared façade in `backend/gateway/`.

Common libraries, API contracts, and utilities live in `backend/libs/`.

Each service includes its own documentation and tooling.

---

## Local CLI + Engine (MVP)

Build binaries from the repository root:

```bash
go build -o dist/bin/sqlrs-engine ./backend/local-engine-go/cmd/sqlrs-engine
go build -o dist/bin/sqlrs ./frontend/cli-go/cmd/sqlrs
```

Run the engine and check health via the CLI:

```bash
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=./sqlrs-work/config \
XDG_STATE_HOME=./sqlrs-work/state \
XDG_CACHE_HOME=./sqlrs-work/cache \
./dist/bin/sqlrs-engine \
  --listen 127.0.0.1:0 \
  --run-dir ./sqlrs-work/state/sqlrs/run \
  --write-engine-json ./sqlrs-work/state/sqlrs/engine.json \
  --idle-timeout 30s

SQLRS_DAEMON_PATH=./dist/bin/sqlrs-engine \
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=./sqlrs-work/config \
XDG_STATE_HOME=./sqlrs-work/state \
XDG_CACHE_HOME=./sqlrs-work/cache \
./dist/bin/sqlrs status
```

Scripts for typical scenarios:

```bash
node scripts/dev/local-status.mjs
node scripts/dev/run-local-engine.mjs
```

### **Documentation**

Architecture, specifications, ADRs, and design notes live in `docs/`.
Start from:

- [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) — doc index
- [`docs/architecture/README.md`](docs/architecture/README.md) — architecture overview and per-service docs
- [`docs/requirements-architecture.md`](docs/requirements-architecture.md) - core requirements
- [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) — roadmap and milestones

---

### **Research**

Experimental data, benchmarks, LaTeX papers, and notebooks live in `research/`.

This section supports the development of snapshot strategies, SQL execution models, and performance analysis.
