# sqlrs prepare

## Overview

`sqlrs prepare` is the only command that can **deterministically construct or restore**
a database state in sqlrs.

A `prepare` invocation:

1. Identifies an immutable **state** based on its arguments and inputs.
2. Ensures this state exists (by reusing or building it).
3. Creates a mutable **instance** derived from this state.
4. Returns a DSN pointing to that instance.

All reproducibility guarantees in sqlrs rely on `prepare`.

---

## Terminology

- **State** - an immutable database state produced by a deterministic preparation process.
- **Instance** - a mutable copy of a state; all database modifications happen here.

---

## Command Syntax

```text
sqlrs prepare:<kind> [--watch|--no-watch] [--image <image-id>] [--] [tool-args...]
```

Where:

- `:<kind>` selects the preparation variant (for example, `psql`, `lb`).
- `--watch` keeps the CLI attached to the job until terminal status (default).
- `--no-watch` submits the job and exits immediately with job references.
- `--image <image-id>` overrides the base DB image.
- `tool-args` are forwarded to the underlying tool for the selected kind.

### Variant docs

- `psql`: [`sqlrs-prepare-psql.md`](sqlrs-prepare-psql.md)
- `lb`: [`sqlrs-prepare-liquibase.md`](sqlrs-prepare-liquibase.md)

## Base Image Selection (Common)

The base container image id is resolved in this order:

1. `--image <image-id>` command-line flag
2. Workspace config (`.sqlrs/config.yaml`, `dbms.image`)
3. Global config (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sqlrs/config.yaml`, `dbms.image`)

If the resolved image id does not include a digest, the engine resolves it to a
canonical digest (for example `postgres:15@sha256:...`) before planning or
execution. If the digest cannot be resolved, `prepare` fails.

When a digest resolution is required, the job includes a `resolve_image` task
before any planning or execution.

Config key:

```yaml
dbms:
  image: postgres:17
```

When `-v/--verbose` is set, sqlrs prints the resolved image id and its source.

---

## Local Execution (MVP)

For local profiles, the engine performs real execution:

- Requires a local container runtime (`docker` or `podman`); the selected tool runs inside a container.
- Runtime mode is configured via engine config key `container.runtime` (`auto|docker|podman`).
- `SQLRS_CONTAINER_RUNTIME` is an operational override (for CI/debug scenarios).
- In `auto` mode, probe order is `docker`, then `podman`.
- On macOS with Podman, if `CONTAINER_HOST` is unset, the engine reads it from the default Podman connection.
- State data is stored under `<StateDir>/state-store` (outside containers).
- Each task snapshots the DB state; the engine prefers OverlayFS on Linux, can use
  btrfs subvolume snapshots when configured, and falls back to full copy.
- The prepare container stays running after the job; the instance is recorded as
  warm and a future `sqlrs run` will decide when to stop it.

---

## State Identification

State identification depends on the **prepare kind** and is documented in each
variant guide.

---

## Error Conditions

`sqlrs prepare` may fail with the following errors:

- **Invalid inputs**
  - Missing files required by the selected variant.
  - Invalid arguments for the selected `prepare:<kind>`.

- **Executor failure**
  - Underlying tool exited with non-zero status.

- **Engine errors**
  - Storage backend unavailable.
  - Insufficient permissions.

All errors are reported before any mutable instance is exposed.

---

## Output

On success, `prepare` prints the DSN of the selected instance to stdout.
With `-v/--verbose`, extra details (including image source) are printed to stderr.

Example:

```text
DSN=postgres://...
```

This DSN uniquely identifies the instance and can be consumed by `sqlrs run`
or external applications.

When `--no-watch` is used, `prepare` prints job references instead of a DSN:

```text
JOB_ID=<job-id>
STATUS_URL=/v1/prepare-jobs/<job-id>
EVENTS_URL=/v1/prepare-jobs/<job-id>/events
```

Use [`sqlrs-watch.md`](sqlrs-watch.md) to attach later.

---

## Job Monitoring (Events-First)

`sqlrs prepare` monitors engine progress through the job events stream rather
than periodic status polling.

### Event Stream Rules

- The CLI uses the `events_url` returned by `POST /v1/prepare-jobs`.
- The events stream is newline-delimited JSON (`application/x-ndjson`).
- The engine emits task/status events plus log events from tool execution.
- During long-running tasks, the engine repeats the last task event with a new
  timestamp when no new events appear for ~500ms, so the CLI can keep showing
  progress even if the underlying system is quiet.
- The CLI reads events until the stream is exhausted:
  - If the response status is 200 and `Content-Length` is present, the stream is
    considered complete after the declared byte length is fully read.
  - If the response is any 4xx status, the stream is considered complete and
    the command fails.
- If the stream ends without a definitive job outcome (`succeeded`, `failed`,
   or `cancelled`),
  the command fails with an error.

### Status Validation

When a status event is received (queued, running, succeeded, failed, cancelled), the CLI
re-fetches the job status via `GET /v1/prepare-jobs/{jobId}` to confirm the
final result. The job is considered complete only when the status endpoint
returns `succeeded`, `failed`, or `cancelled`.

### Progress UX

Progress events are printed to stderr. By default, the CLI rewrites the same
line and shows a spinner when events repeat. It also includes the `message` from
the latest event if present.

With `--verbose`, each event is printed on a new line (no overwriting).

During interactive watch mode, `Ctrl+C` opens the control prompt:

```text
[s] stop  [d] detach  [Esc/Enter] continue
```

Rules:

- `s` asks for explicit confirmation (`Cancel job? [y/N]`) and then requests cancellation.
- `d` detaches from the job and leaves it running.
- `Esc` or `Enter` resumes watch.
- Repeated `Ctrl+C` while prompt is open is treated as `continue`.

For composite invocation `prepare ... run ...`, `detach` means:

- disconnect from `prepare`,
- skip the subsequent `run` phase in this CLI process,
- exit successfully after printing the `job_id` and a message that `run` was skipped.

---

## Guarantees

- `prepare` is idempotent with respect to state identification.
- State objects are immutable once created.
