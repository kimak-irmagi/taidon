# Architecture desision record agent instructions

When working on the documents in this folder, follow these rules:

1. Each ADR record should contain:
   - The conversation timestamp
   - The github user id involved in the decision (request the value from the user when needed)
   - The agent name/version involved in the decision
   - The question discussed
   - The alternatives considered
   - The chosen solution or decision made
   - The brief rationale of the decision
2. If multiple decisions are made within a single session, each should have a separate ADR record, though they may share the same .md file.
