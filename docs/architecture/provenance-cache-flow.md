# Provenance and Cache-Explain Flow

This document describes the approved interaction flow for the next bounded
local slice after ref-backed `plan` / `prepare`:

- `--provenance-path <path>` on single-stage local `plan` / `prepare`
- `sqlrs cache explain prepare ...` for one single-stage prepare-oriented
  decision

It follows the accepted user-facing shapes in:

- [`../user-guides/sqlrs-provenance.md`](../user-guides/sqlrs-provenance.md)
- [`../user-guides/sqlrs-cache-explain.md`](../user-guides/sqlrs-cache-explain.md)

This slice is intentionally narrow:

- it supports single-stage local `plan` and `prepare` only;
- it supports raw and alias-backed prepare flows;
- it supports both normal local filesystem execution and bounded local `--ref`;
- provenance is a JSON side artifact only;
- `cache explain` is read-only and prepare-oriented only;
- it does not yet support standalone `run`;
- it does not yet support composite `prepare ... run ...`;
- it does not yet support remote/server-side execution or explanation.

## 1. Participants

- **User** - invokes `sqlrs plan`, `sqlrs prepare`, or `sqlrs cache explain`.
- **CLI parser** - parses command-specific flags and wrapped prepare stages.
- **Command context** - resolves cwd, workspace root, output mode, and verbose
  settings.
- **Stage binder** - binds raw or alias-backed prepare inputs, including
  bounded local `--ref` resolution through the shared ref context path.
- **Shared inputset collector** - computes the deterministic local input graph
  and content hashes for the selected prepare kind.
- **Prepare trace helper** - combines local command metadata, ref metadata,
  normalized stage inputs, and input hashes into one reusable diagnostic trace.
- **Cache explain API client** - submits the bound prepare request to the engine
  for a read-only cache explanation.
- **Engine cache explain endpoint** - computes the same final prepare signature
  and cache lookup the engine would use for real execution.
- **Plan/prepare app flow** - runs the normal existing `plan` or `prepare`
  pipeline when the command is not read-only cache explanation.
- **Provenance writer** - serializes the final provenance JSON artifact when
  `--provenance-path` is requested.
- **Renderer** - emits human/JSON `cache explain` output and the existing
  `plan` / `prepare` command results.

## 2. Flow A: `sqlrs cache explain prepare ...`

```mermaid

  participant BIND as Stage binder
  participant INPUT as Shared inputset collector
  participant TRACE as Prepare trace helper
  participant API as Cache explain API client
  participant ENGINE as Engine cache explain endpoint
  User->>CLI: sqlrs cache explain prepare ...
  CLI->>CTX: resolve cwd, workspace root, output mode, verbose
  CLI->>BIND: bind wrapped prepare stage (raw or alias, optional --ref)
  BIND-->>CLI: normalized bound stage + cleanup
  CLI->>INPUT: collect deterministic input graph + hashes
  INPUT-->>CLI: input manifest
  CLI->>TRACE: assemble local trace context
  TRACE-->>CLI: explain request + local metadata
  CLI->>API: POST /v1/cache/explain/prepare
  API->>ENGINE: bound prepare request
  ENGINE-->>API: hit/miss + signature + matched state id/reason
  API-->>CLI: cache decision response
  CLI->>TRACE: merge engine decision with local metadata
  TRACE-->>CLI: renderer view model
  CLI-->>User: human or JSON cache explanation
```

Key rule: the wrapped stage is bound exactly the same way as real single-stage
`prepare`, including alias resolution, projected-cwd `--ref` semantics, and
kind-specific closure traversal.

## 3. Flow B: `sqlrs plan|prepare --provenance-path ...`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant BIND as Stage binder
  participant INPUT as Shared inputset collector
  participant TRACE as Prepare trace helper
  participant API as Cache explain API client
  participant APP as Plan/prepare app flow
  participant WRITE as Provenance writer
  User->>CLI: sqlrs plan|prepare --provenance-path <path> ...
  CLI->>CTX: resolve cwd, workspace root, output mode, verbose
  CLI->>BIND: bind selected stage (raw or alias, optional --ref)
  BIND-->>CLI: normalized bound stage + cleanup
  CLI->>INPUT: collect deterministic input graph + hashes
  INPUT-->>CLI: input manifest
  CLI->>TRACE: assemble local trace context
  TRACE-->>CLI: explain request + local metadata
  CLI->>API: POST /v1/cache/explain/prepare
  API-->>CLI: pre-execution cache decision
  CLI->>APP: run normal plan or prepare flow
  APP-->>CLI: plan result or prepare outcome
  CLI->>TRACE: merge outcome with local metadata + explain response
  TRACE-->>CLI: provenance artifact
  CLI->>WRITE: write JSON side artifact
  WRITE-->>CLI: write success or failure
  CLI-->>User: unchanged plan/prepare primary output
```

Important behavior rule: provenance records the cache decision observed
immediately before execution. If cache state changes between that read-only
explain call and the real `prepare`, the artifact still reflects the correct
pre-execution diagnostic snapshot for this invocation.

Commands without `--provenance-path` keep the current `plan` / `prepare` flow
and do not pay for the additional explain call.

## 4. Trace payload split

The reusable trace is built from two sources.

### 4.1 CLI-local fields

Collected locally before any engine explain call:

- command family (`plan` or `prepare`)
- prepare kind and class (raw or alias)
- workspace root and caller cwd
- selected alias path when applicable
- requested ref metadata and resolved ref context when applicable
- normalized prepare arguments
- deterministic input manifest:
  - logical path
  - host path used for execution when relevant
  - stable content hash

### 4.2 Engine-derived fields

Returned by the read-only cache explain endpoint:

- final-state decision (`hit` or `miss`)
- engine-computed signature
- matched state id when present
- reason code when the final state is absent
- resolved image id when the engine can report it

### 4.3 Terminal outcome fields

Added only for provenance-writing commands:

- final command status (`succeeded`, `failed`, `canceled`)
- plan-only vs prepare execution mode
- resulting state id or job id when available
- error summary when execution fails after binding

## 5. Failure handling

- Early usage and parsing errors do not emit provenance.
- If stage binding fails before a deterministic input manifest exists, the
  command fails normally without writing provenance.
- `cache explain` failures stay regular command errors; the command does not
  print partial diagnostic output.
- Execution failures after the trace exists should still write provenance with a
  failed terminal outcome.
- If provenance writing fails after the main command completed, the command
  fails and reports that write error explicitly.
- Detached-worktree or blob staging cleanup still follows the same cleanup rules
  already accepted for ref-backed `plan` / `prepare`.

## 6. Out-of-scope follow-ups

- provenance for standalone `run`
- provenance for composite `prepare ... run ...`
- `sqlrs cache explain plan ...`
- `sqlrs cache explain run ...`
- cache-eviction advice or store-health diagnostics
- remote/server-side provenance capture
- remote/server-side cache explanation
